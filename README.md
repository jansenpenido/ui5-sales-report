# SAPUI5 Sales Report

This is a simple SAPUI5 application that displays reports from each salesman of a company. The data is consumed from [Northwind OData service](http://services.odata.org/V3/Northwind/Northwind.svc).


## Resources
The project was created using the SAP Web IDE available at [SAP Cloud Platform](https://cloudplatform.sap.com).

The instructions to set up the OData connection to Northwind can be found [here](https://blogs.sap.com/2014/07/07/how-to-use-northwind-odata-service-with-sap-river-rde).
